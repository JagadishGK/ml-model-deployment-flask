# Salary Prediction using Machine Learning (Flask Deployment)

This project demonstrates deployment of a Machine Learning model using Flask. 
The model predicts salary based on experience, test score, and interview score.

## Features
- Linear Regression model for salary prediction
- Flask web application for real-time prediction
- Model serialization using pickle
- End-to-end ML workflow (training → deployment)

## Tech Stack
Python, Flask, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas

## How it works
User enters details → Flask receives input → Model predicts salary → Result displayed

## Run locally
python3 application.py
Then open: http://127.0.0.1:5000
